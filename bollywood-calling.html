to have a small time shop in Delhi, Akshay Kumar was
a cook in Bangkok and Vidya Balan featured in small ads.
These are the examples that inspire thousands of aspiring actors
who throng to Mumbai in pursuit of money and fame in Bollywood.
In reality, it's only five percent of those who see their dreams reaching the
level  they  set  for  themselves.  Yet,  braving  all  odds majority of the pack, 
labelled  as  "strugglers"  in  Bollywood  parlance,  continues to dream of becoming 
the next Amitabh Bachchan or SRK. </p><p>                                                                           

</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good actor always finds work for himself," Misra said in an interview to the Times of India.
An  advise  200 aspiring actors, who register themselves with the Cine and Television Artistes' 
Association  every  month, do not pay heed to believing that meeting people at film parties and 
going  to  gym  to  smarten  up  their appearances only will get them work."It's the HOPE that 
doesn't let a struggler give up. He laps up rare examples of SRK and Big B and says to himself 
that  he  too  will become like them someday,"When an aspiring actor comes to Mumbai he goes 
from one production house to another looking for jobs. He then, on advice of those in the know 
of things, enrolls himself into an acting institute. It's only then does it gradually dawns on him 
what the industry is all about.</p><p>                                                                                                   

</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even  after  completing  the  acting  training  his  struggle continues. Post the acting course his 
struggle  picks  up  momentum.  He  learns  about  an  ongoing  casting for a film or TV project. 
He  goes  to  the  production  house  and  takes  the  audition  (test)  to  land a role for himself. 
Thereafter,  all  depends  on his talent and luck if he bags the project.Generally, most aspirants 
do  not  get  to  meet  the director. Therefore, a struggler meets the casting guy who assures him 
that  he  decides  who is taken in by the director. But a source says that the casting people only 
select  for  smaller roles. The roles for the main hero and heroine are left on the captain of ship - 
the  film's  director - and without his nod the casting guy cannot take anybody, in films. At the 
most  the  casting  guy  recommend  can  recommends  actors  for  small  roles  and  the  ratio of 
struggler against successful actors is a dismal 100:2.</p><p>                                                                  

</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to an estimate, each day, there are around 2000 aspiring actors coming in to Mumbai.
Moreover,  even  if  one  is  called  to  audition  for  a  role,  there  are  50  options for one role, 
narrowing the chances of landing the job. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Originally posted in 2008.
